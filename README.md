This is a small project which both I and my friends do in "Power Electronics" class. 

During the period of social distancing brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional classroom activities, including final examinations, were significantly disrupted. As a result, our lecturer proposed an alternative assessment method by coordinating with the school to replace the standard final exam with a small-scale project that allowed students to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical context. Based on the topics we had studied throughout the Power Electronics course, our lecturer assigned us a relevant and thought-provoking project that aligned closely with the course objectives.

In the document titled Final Report of Power Electronics.docx, the structure of the report is designed to clearly present the problem statement at the beginning, providing readers with a context for the challenge being addressed. This is then followed by a comprehensive solution that includes a detailed system model and simulation. To verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed solution, I utilized MATLAB as the primary tool for conducting simulations and analyzing system performance under various conditions.
